# Ultimate Dark Mode Skin for Steam
This is a pack that merges a few different dark mode skins for Steam, courtesy of [BallOpener's guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1941650801). It's a mix of:

- [Metro for Steam](https://metroforsteam.com/) by Dominic Minischetti III
- [Unofficial Patch for Metro for Steam](https://github.com/redsigma/UPMetroSkin) (by RedSigma) with the [following options](https://pastebin.com/N6d0CSVu)
- [Steam Dark Mode](https://github.com/AikoMidori/steam-dark-mode) (by Shiina) for the web pages, but I made a few color changes to the Carousel Thumbs (dots below the displays on store, normal color's gray)
- [Steam Library Makeover](https://github.com/AikoMidori/steam-library) by Shiina
- [Custom Friends UI Tool](https://steamchatskinning.tk/#customisation) by LaserFlash <br/>

# Installation
After [downloading](https://github.com/hyoretsu/Ultimate-Steam-Dark-Mode-Skin/releases/latest), drag and drop all 3 folders to Steam's main folder and select "Metro For Steam" under Settings->Interface->"Select the skin you wish Steam to use". Open [PhantomGamers](https://github.com/PhantomGamers)' [SFP](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP/releases/latest) after restarting Steam and click Patch. I also recommend turning on "Patch on App Startup", "Scan on App Startup" and "Check For Updates On Startup".

Note: if you used the old Steam Friends Patcher, run "Reset Steam" before patching.
